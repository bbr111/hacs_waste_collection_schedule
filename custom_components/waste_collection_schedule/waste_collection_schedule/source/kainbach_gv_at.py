"""Kainbach bei Graz, Austria.

The municipality publishes its collection calendar as a yearly text PDF
("Abfuhrkalender") linked from its waste page, and posts next year's calendar
while the current one is still running (the 2027 PDF went up in October 2026).
``retrievers.yearly_links`` therefore lists every calendar from this year on and
``FanOutRetriever`` downloads each, so the rest of this year is not dropped when
next year's appears. The file names differ from year to year
("8010-Kainbach_bei_Graz_2026.pdf", "Abfuhrkalender2027.pdf"); both end in the
year, which is also what dates the grid.

Each PDF is the usual two-page day grid (one line per day, "14 Mi B"), read by
``PdfTextCalendar.DayGridCalendarParser``. The cells print short codes glued
together ("BB1GB" is Bioabfall, Bioabfall 4-weekly and bin cleaning), which the
parser's ``codes`` table splits. The printed weekdays are checked against the
calendar year, so a PDF that does not fit the year in its file name fails
loudly instead of returning shifted dates.

The calendar has no per-household selector: households with a 4-weekly
organic (B1) or 8-weekly residual (R1) bin are collected only on the days
printed with that code, and the reduced rounds always coincide with a full
round. Both map to the same canonical type, so the raw label is carried and
duplicates are merged by default.
